# 📈 Linear Regression Project

This repository contains a detailed **Linear Regression** notebook aimed at understanding the relationship between variables through statistical modeling.  
The purpose of this notebook is to **explore the dataset**, **build a predictive model**, and **evaluate its performance** — serving as a fundamental introduction to regression analysis in machine learning.

## 📁 File Structure

- **Linear_Regression.ipynb**:  
  The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, analysis, model building, and evaluation related to the linear regression project.

## 📊 What’s Inside — Workflow Overview

This notebook follows a complete and structured workflow for implementing Linear Regression:

### 🧹 Data Exploration and Cleaning

- Loading datasets and checking for missing values, duplicate records, and outliers.
- Summarizing key features with mean, median, and standard deviation.

### 📈 Data Visualization

- Scatter plots and correlation heatmaps to understand the relationships between variables.
- Regression plots to visualize the line of best fit.

### 🛠 Feature Engineering and Selection

- Identifying independent (input) and dependent (target) variables.
- Splitting the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.

### 🧠 Model Building

- Applying **Linear Regression** using **scikit-learn**.
- Fitting the model to the training data.

### 📏 Model Evaluation

- Calculating key performance metrics:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **R² Score** (Coefficient of Determination)

### 📊 Predictions

- Making predictions on the test set.
- Visual comparison between predicted vs actual values.
